# chainchat
The world's first secure messaging platform that separates the message creation, 
from the transfer (creation) and reception of the message using a decentralized 
messaging backbone to allow anyone anywhere the ability to send a secure message 
across multiple channels traceable in a decentralized ledger.

Chainchat is just like Slack, except it's cryptographically secure and safe from 
malicious hackers.
